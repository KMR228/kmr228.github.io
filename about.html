      <p> I was born and raised in Hamilton, New Jersey. After graduating from Steinert
      High School in 2018, I was relunctant to move away from home. I later decided
      to go to Mercer County Community College where I recieved my Associates degree
      in Liberal Arts. </p>

      <p> Since I was undecided, I decided to take a couple different classes to
      see what I was actually interested in. I later chose to study
      communications and sociology. After I graduated in 2020, I decided to transfer
      to the University of Miami to recieve my bachelors in Communications.</p>

      <p> On a personal note, when I'm not studying, I love traveling, taking pictures,
      exercising, and spending time with loved ones. </p>
