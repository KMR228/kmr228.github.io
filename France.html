    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p><a href= "https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/fr.html">
      France </a> today is one of the most modern countries in the world and is a leader
      among European nations. It plays an influential global role as a
      permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, NATO, the G-7,
      the G-20, the EU, and other multilateral organizations. </p>

    <p>France rejoined NATO's integrated military command structure in 2009,
      reversing <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-de-Gaulle-president-of-France"
      >DE GAULLE'S </a> 1966 decision to withdraw French forces from NATO.
      Since 1958, it has constructed a hybrid presidential-parliamentary governing
      system resistant to the instabilities experienced in earlier, more purely
      parliamentary administrations. </p>

    <p>In recent decades, its reconciliation and cooperation with Germany have
      proved central to the economic integration of Europe, including the
      introduction of a common currency, the euro, in January 1999. In the early
      21st century, five French overseas entities - French Guiana, Guadeloupe,
      Martinique, Mayotte, and Reunion - became French regions and were made part
      of France proper. </p>
